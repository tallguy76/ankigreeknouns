The fork from jeidsath's version was motivated by the desire for more detailed noun cards and more concise verb cards. Noun forms in parentheses are Ionic or Doric or hypothetical reconstructed forms shown to clarify the root morphology. Noun forms separated by a slash are variants attested in Attic writing.

1.  nouns.txt, for recognizing noun forms and recalling articles, gender, and dictionary forms
